Shinmeikai Definitions Addon

Lets the user get the shinmeikai definition for one or multiple words at once.
Addon also supports RTK keywords for kanji as well as furigana for the definitions.
The furigana generation uses mecab from the japanese support pugin, so the japanese
support plugin is necessary for this feature.

To edit the config go to:
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\addons\shinmeikai_definitions\config.py

Please contact me if you find any bugs!
