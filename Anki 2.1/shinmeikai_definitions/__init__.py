#Shinmeikai Definitions Addon
#
#Lets the user get the shinmeikai definition for one or multiple words at once.
#Addon also supports RTK keywords for kanji as well as furigana for the definitions.
#The furigana generation uses mecab from the japanese support pugin, so the japanese
#support plugin is necessary for this feature.
#
#To edit the config go to:
